# credit-risk-classification

## Purpose of Analysis
In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.  using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

-The goal of this analysis to determine if the Logistic Regression machine learning model is able to accurately predict healthy loans (0)  compared to high-risk loans (1) 



**Dataset**
The data set provided consist of a total of 19,383 records which includes 18,765 records pertaining to healthy records (0) and 619 records pertaining to high risk loans (1).As a side note the the dataset records  distribution is unbalanced or disproportionate.

## Results of the Regression Model

Based on this analysis the logistic regression model did a great job predicting the Healthy loans (0) with a 100% accuracy.  Although precision for  the high risk loan is .84 it did not do as well predicting  the High risk loans(1).

## Summary
*In summary the results of the regression machine learning model is extremely effective in predicting the the healthy loan. Based on this analysis the logistic regression model did a great job predicting the Healthy loans (0) with a 100% accuracy.  Although precision for  the high risk loan is .84 it did not do as well predicting  the High risk loans(1).
